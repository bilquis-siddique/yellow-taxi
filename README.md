# yellow-taxi
This is a data analysis project using the data from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) from the following site: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2016-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/k67s-dv2t.

The dataset includes trip records of all trips completed in yellow taxis in NYC from January to June in 2016. Records include pick-up and drop-off dates/times/locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data was collected and provided to the TLC by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab Passenger Enhancement Program (TPEP). 

I wrote these Python scripts utilizing the pandas, Matplotlib and Nominatim libraries in order to analyze the data in a Jupyter Notebook.
